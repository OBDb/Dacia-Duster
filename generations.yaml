generations:
  - name: "First Generation (HS)"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The original Dacia Duster was a game-changer in the budget SUV segment, offering robust design and genuine off-road capability at an exceptionally competitive price point. Built on the Renault-Nissan B0 platform shared with various Renault and Nissan models, it was available in both front-wheel and four-wheel drive configurations. Engine options included various petrol and diesel units, typically ranging from 1.2L to 2.0L, with modest power outputs prioritizing reliability and efficiency over performance. The interior was basic and utilitarian, focusing on durability rather than luxury, with simple controls and hard-wearing materials. Despite its budget positioning, the Duster offered genuine off-road credibility with good ground clearance, short overhangs, and a capable 4WD system. This first generation established the Duster as a phenomenally successful model for Dacia, appealing to pragmatic buyers seeking SUV practicality without premium pricing."

  - name: "First Generation (HS) 2013 Facelift"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2017
    description: "In September 2013, the facelifted Dacia Duster was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show, introducing significant styling updates. The exterior received important changes in the front with a new chromed grille and redesigned headlights, restyled roof bars, and new 16-inch wheels with modest modifications in the rear. The interior was renewed with design and features similar to those introduced on the new models in the Dacia line-up. A new TCe 125 1.2-litre direct-injection turbo engine was introduced as a more efficient powertrain option. In 2016, the Duster received a new steering wheel and a Blackshadow trim variant. The facelift maintained the successful off-road capabilities and value proposition of the original, continuing to appeal to budget-conscious buyers seeking genuine SUV practicality."

  - name: "Second Generation (HM)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The second-generation Duster was announced between 14 and 24 September 2017 during the Frankfurt Motor Show, with production models reaching the Romanian market in November 2017. Built on an updated version of the B0 platform (B0+), it featured completely new bodywork with more modern styling but preserved the recognizable Duster silhouette and proportions. Nearly every body panel was new, though dimensions remained nearly identical. Engine options evolved to include more efficient units including a 1.0L I3 turbo petrol, 1.2L and 1.3L TCe petrol, and 1.5L dCi diesel engines. The interior saw significant improvements in design, quality, and technology, including electric power steering, a four-camera MultiView system, blind-spot warning, automatic climate control, and keyless entry. Safety features were enhanced with multiple airbags and electronic stability control. Four-wheel drive variants maintained impressive off-road capability with hill descent control and hill-start assist. This generation successfully modernized the Duster while maintaining its value proposition."

  - name: "Second Generation (HM) 2021 Facelift"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The restyled version of the Duster was presented on June 22, 2021, and went on sale in September 2021. The facelifted version featured a new light signature both front and rear, similar to the third-generation Sandero, with an updated Y-shaped LED daytime running light pattern. The grille pattern was slightly simplified and a sliding central armrest was added inside. The number of engines available was reduced, with two petrol engines of 130 and 150 hp, a petrol/LPG version of 100 hp, and a 115 hp diesel engine available in all-wheel drive. The most powerful engine became available as standard with the 6-speed automatic transmission (EDC6). In June 2022, as part of a brand-wide refresh, the Duster received an update featuring the brand's new logo, a redesigned grille, updated steering wheel, and refreshed badges. This final iteration of the second generation maintained the successful formula while incorporating the latest Dacia brand identity."

  - name: "Third Generation (P1310)"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The latest Duster represents the most significant redesign since the model's introduction, adopting Dacia's new design language with a more robust and contemporary appearance. The third generation was unveiled on 29 November 2023 in Portugal and began production in December 2023. Built on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance's CMF-B platform (shared with the Sandero, Logan, and Jogger), it features improved proportions with a more muscular stance and boxy exterior design with new Y-shaped light signature. The powertrain lineup embraces electrification with mild-hybrid technology standard on most engines, plus new full-hybrid options combining 1.6L or 1.8L petrol engines with electric motors for significantly improved efficiency. Bi-fuel petrol/LPG options remain available (ECO-G), maintaining Dacia's focus on affordable motoring. Diesel engines (1.5L dCi) continue in limited markets only. Four-wheel drive continues to be offered with multiple terrain modes (Auto, Snow, Mud/Sand, Off-Road, Eco) and hill descent control. The interior features a completely redesigned dashboard with a 10.1-inch touchscreen (largest yet) and a 7-inch digital instrument cluster with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto wireless connectivity. The trunk volume increased to 472 litres. Despite these advancements, the third-generation Duster remains true to Dacia's value-oriented philosophy, offering modern features and improved refinement while maintaining competitive pricing."
