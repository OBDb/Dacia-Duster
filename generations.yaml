    description: "The original Dacia Duster was a game-changer in the budget SUV segment, offering robust design and genuine off-road capability at an exceptionally competitive price point. Built on the Renault-Nissan B0 platform shared with various Renault and Nissan models, it was available in both front-wheel and four-wheel drive configurations. Engine options included various petrol and diesel units, typically ranging from 1.2L to 2.0L, with modest power outputs prioritizing reliability and efficiency over performance. The interior was basic and utilitarian, focusing on durability rather than luxury, with simple controls and hard-wearing materials. A significant facelift in 2013 updated the styling and added some equipment improvements. Despite its budget positioning, the Duster offered genuine off-road credibility with good ground clearance, short overhangs, and a capable 4WD system. This generation established the Duster as a phenomenally successful model for Dacia, appealing to pragmatic buyers seeking SUV practicality without premium pricing."

  - name: "Second Generation (H79 Phase 2)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The second-generation Duster maintained the successful formula of its predecessor while addressing key criticisms. Built on an updated version of the B0 platform, it featured completely new bodywork with more modern styling but preserved the recognizable Duster silhouette and proportions. Engine options evolved to include more efficient units including a 1.0L TCe turbo petrol and 1.5L dCi diesel, with the later addition of a factory-fitted LPG system on some petrol engines. The interior saw significant improvements in design, quality, and technology, including an available touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and backup camera. Safety features were enhanced with the addition of features like blind-spot monitoring and multi-view camera system. Four-wheel drive variants maintained impressive off-road capability with hill descent control and a dedicated off-road information display. A facelift in 2021 introduced Y-shaped LED daytime running lights, updated grille design, and further interior improvements. This generation successfully modernized the Duster while maintaining its value proposition, continuing as Dacia's best-selling model in many markets."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The latest Duster represents the most significant redesign since the model's introduction, adopting Dacia's new design language with a more robust and contemporary appearance. Built on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance's CMF-B platform shared with the Sandero, it features improved proportions with a more muscular stance. The powertrain lineup embraces electrification with mild-hybrid technology standard on most engines, plus a new full-hybrid option combining a 1.6L petrol engine with electric motors for significantly improved efficiency. Conventional petrol engines and LPG bi-fuel options remain available, maintaining Dacia's focus on affordable motoring. Four-wheel drive continues to be offered, preserving the Duster's genuine off-road credentials with multiple terrain modes and hill descent control. The interior marks a major step forward with a completely redesigned dashboard featuring larger displays, improved materials, and enhanced technology including wireless smartphone connectivity. Despite these advancements, the third-generation Duster remains true to Dacia's value-oriented philosophy, offering modern features and improved refinement while maintaining competitive pricing that undercuts similarly-sized competitors."
